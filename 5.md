# 5. Later History of the Society

The order continued with various successes, yet on the whole gaining strength, till the year 1773, when at the demand of several Catholic sovereigns, it was suppressed by Clement XIV. The struggle which preceded its dissolution was long and desperate. Nothing but the determinate energy of the most powerful monarchs and nobles of Europe, effected an event so important in the history of the world. But it fell, because it could be endured no longer. Neither the church nor the state could live under this once useful servant, now grown to be a tyrannical master. It had, indeed, been a most useful servant, but it had gathered an independent force which was felt to be capable of most terrific perversion. Already Popes and Kings had more than once felt this force used against themselves, as a second Providence; or breaking their counsels in pieces like another Nemesis, certain, remorseless, and inscrutable in its revenge.

The height of power to which it had attained, and the degree of influence which it had exerted, may be judged from the following view of its establishments, as taken from a catalogue sent from Rome in 1762. This catalogue exhibits five Assistances; 39 Provinces; 249 houses for the Professed; 699 Colleges; 51 Novitiates; 176 Seminaries; 335 Residences; 223 Missions; 22,787 Jesuits, of whom 11,010 were priests. But the order, though suppressed, did not cease to exert its influence. In Catholic countries, the priests took their place among the regular clergy of the church, the professors\* and teachers were sought for their scholarship, and in! many instances, as in the English college at Bruges, the head of the college was continued at his post, and the institution, under the name of an Academy, exerted the same influence as before.

Strange as it may seem, the Jesuits owed their preservation as an order, to the Empress Catharine of Russia. She owed no allegiance to the Pope, and yet she was a zealous friend to the Pope's imperial guard; partly, it may be, because she valued their influence as educators of her people; partly, because she sought to draw into her kingdom the ablest and most sagacious men from western Europe, that she might use their knowledge and sagacity in her plans of empire, and perhaps that she might, under their tuition, perfect that system of bribery, espionage and skill, which is the wonder, as it is the abhorrence, of Christendom. Under Catharine, Paul and Alexander, the order was re-constituted as at first. In the other countries of Europe it still held a being, but under feigned names, and as a broken and suspected, though strong and formidable body. The Pope, though aware of its existence, was forced to ignore and deny it. But in Russia, it boasted of its name, plied to the utmost its energies, and under the protection of the barbarian of the North, conspired for the restoration of legitimized despotism to distracted Europe. Here too its forces were recruited by a seminary for novices upon Russian soil, till at last the Pope dared to give his sanction to the society in Russia, while still an outcast from every Catholic country. The Jesuits were encouraged to direct the extensive colonies, which Alexander planted in the steppes of eastern Russia. They carried there religion and the arts, and exerted a most important influence. So confident were the Jesuits of great influence over the empire, that they meditated an extensive educational establishment, separate from the University of Russia. They addressed a memorial to this effect to Alexander in 1811, which was favorably received. After the French invasion, when the Emperor resumed the arts of peace and his projects of internal reform, he had become so alarmed at the Catholic movement, which had been quietly advancing among his people and his nobles, that he declined the proposition. For ten years or more, the Russian cabinet watched with suspicion their cherished ally. At last, when leading nobles declared themselves for Rome, the court awoke to the fact, that by means of education the Jesuits had influenced thousands of influential youth towards the Roman faith, and in 1829 they were banished the empire. No fact speaks more loudly of the determined sympathy of the Jesuits with despotism, than that the Russian power, though fanatical in its bigoted hostility to the Romish church, called into its service, and admitted within its borders, that society, which was more Romish if possible, than Rome itself. No comment can be more significant upon the strength of that bond of interest and of fear, by which the Pope was fastened to the Jesuits, than that furnished by the countenance which he extended to them during their long banishment. No fact, can better illustrate their subtlety, their ingratitude, their dangerous art, and their magic resources, than the boldness and success of their proselytism of the Russian youth. No testimony can be more striking of the value of their services in the cause of despotism, than that each legitimate monarch called them to his aid as soon as he dared, and when “order reigned” in Europe after the Congress of Vienna, the Jesuits were again restored, in the freshness and strength of their eternal youth. From Russia, the Duke of Parma in 1793 recalled Jesuit teachers into his Duchy, who at once opened five establishments, around which rallied the youth of the country, and in 1804 the king of Naples received them also, and made them the teachers of his subjects. In 1814, the order was formally revived, as the most important defense to the cause of absolutism, which was then renewing its hold of Europe, and from that time till very recently, with the exception of a nominal banishment under Louis Phillippe, it has had free access to almost every country in the world. Their recent history in Belgium and France, deserves a moment's attention, especially from those who affect to believe that their energy and influence as educators has declined. We find them in 1816, resisting the constitution of Holland, which secured freedom of instruction, because it took from the church its birthright, to direct the education of the young. In consequence of these movements, they were expelled the kingdom. They immediately set up schools of a high character near the frontier, and educated the sons of rich and noble Catholics, who returned filled with hostility to the government, and ready for any sedition. After 1830, the Jesuits returned to the kingdom of Belgium, when under the new constitutional guaranties of the “liberty of instruction” and “the liberty of association,” they multiplied their institutions, drew into them all the youth of the nobles, and largely shared in the education of the poor. They attacked the free University of Brussels, which had been established in 1834, by every species of calumny, as an immoral and godless institution. Next we find them in 1844, engaged in a determined effort to control the Catholic University of Louvaine, and arrayed against the highest ecclesiastics of the kingdom, who would not submit to their dictation.

In France, after the Restoration, the Jesuits had a difficult game to play, but they played it boldly. A strong current of popular feeling was against them. The liberal party was avowedly hostile, and Louis XVIII did not dare to give them open toleration. And yet from 1800, they had been secretly at work, and under the protection and favor of the mother and uncle of Napoleon, they had inflamed the common people with a new religious zeal by their itinerant missions, and had gained multitudes of pledged defenders and friends under the name of “the Congregation.” This association included early in the reign of Charles X from eight hundred to one thousand of the nobles, and six millions of the people of France, all pledged to the Jesuits, and ready to act with them. Through the influence of this society, the three famous laws were passed in 1820 against the press, individual liberty, and the elective system, which for the time annihilated the liberal party. After the accession of Charles X a reaction ensued, and in 1828 eight Jesuit colleges were required to yield to the inspection and control of the University. This they declined to do, and were closed. After the revolution of 1830, of which this movement against the Jesuits was a prelude, their efforts were again renewed, and yet when, in 1837, it was proposed to introduce some legal provision against their intrusion into the secondary schools, Girardin thus expressed himself, with the applause of all parties: “What! shall we cherish any longer fear of the Jesuits? With our institutions, with this tribune, with our two chambers, with the philosophical arsenal which we possess in our libraries, shall *we* fear the Jesuits? Let us not so disgrace ourselves in the esteem of all Europe.” Notwithstanding this boasting confidence, France soon found that the Jesuits were not dead, and that all the defenses against their influence, did not prevent them from making an onset upon one of the best established institutions. In 1842, they instigated the Catholic clergy to an attack upon the system of public instruction, which had remained unchanged since the year 1808. Under this system the regulation of all schools and colleges, except those designed expressly for the education of the priesthood, was committed to the University. It was contended by the Jesuits, that this scheme was Atheistic, and was designed to destroy the church, and the restoration of Jesuit institutions was earnestly advocated on the basis of the charter of 1830, which secured freedom of instruction to all. This contest was earnest and continued for years Some of the most eminent of the French writers contended for the continuance of the established system. The Catholic clergy united with the Jesuits in an earnest and zealous cooperation. The bishop of Chalons, in a letter addressed to the king (20th of June, 1845), thus expressed himself in his own name, and that of his brethren in office: “The cause of the Jesuits is the cause of the church, and our cause; we know it right well, that every word against the Jesuits is a war-cry against ourselves.” The king was embarrassed. On the one side, he dared not disobey the voice of the nation as expressed through the deputies; on the other, he dared not offend the Jesuits and the church. At last an arrangement was effected, by which one or two of the more prominent of the Jesuit colleges were closed, and the hosts of others throughout the kingdom were winked at by the police. At this moment in France, as well as throughout all Europe, the Jesuits are in the field, as busy, as subtle, and as influential as ever in the service of despotism and the Holy , See.[^20]

If in the review of this historical sketch, we ask what the Society of Jesus has accomplished for the church of Rome, we need only refer to the following testimony by their eloquent historian and advocate. “Have they not wrested from heresy Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Bavaria, Austria, a portion of the Swiss cantons and the Rhenish provinces? Have they not driven back Calvinism from France, and Italy, after it had already bitten to the core these two Catholic countries? Have they not preserved in England, that germ, which is now expanding with such vigor, and which in Ireland, after three hundred years of martyrdom, is become a lawful revolution?"[^21]

If we ask by what means, above all others united, it has accomplished this work, its friends and enemies will reply in one earnest answer, by means of education in their seminaries of learning. This was avowed in the plan of the founder. This, of all others, is best suited to the genius and spirit of the institution. The convictions of the passionate friends and the bitter enemies of the order throughout Christendom, declare that Jesuit teachers, Jesuit seminaries, and Jesuit education, have been the central agency by which for three centuries the work of the Jesuits has been accomplished.
