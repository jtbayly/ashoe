# 2. The Puritans Characterized

The history of Puritanism claims next to be considered. It is a history far different from that of the society of Ignatius. This interest did not spring into being at once, for it was not the device of man. It was developed by gradual advances and a continuous growth, for it was the work of God. The movement commenced with the Reformation, for the positions taken by the earliest Protestants, implied every principle which the Puritan afterwards developed. The Lutheran was not, however, a Puritan. He did, indeed, protest against a corrupted church and planted his foot upon the revealed word, but he did not learn from that word, that the church was designed to be independent of the State, nor that Christianity secures to man his rights, as truly as it prescribes his duties. Nor did he see that the form by which the church is to be governed was not divinely prescribed; nor again that the same substantial truth may be expressed in different creeds. The Huguenot was not a Puritan, for though gallant in the field, chivalrous in his bearing, courteous in his manners, and martyr-like in his resignation, he adhered too fondly to that feudal spirit which Christianity and freedom were united to disintegrate and destroy. The English Nonconformist was not wholly a Puritan, for he but half understood his own principles. At times he was narrow in his views, bigoted in his intolerance, and fanatical in his spirit. But he dared to resist the power of king and church on the faith of his allegiance to a power that is higher than they, and to try the tenure by which each claimed obedience, by an appeal to charters, to principles and the sword. He dared to reform institutions and laws which were perverted and outworn. The New- England pilgrim had not entirely worked out the problem of applying his master-principles, nor did he fully understand the spirit he was of. And yet, these classes of Protestants, were all moving in the same direction, though they did not know the end to which they were tending. Their spirit and principles were one, although the import and result of these principles were in part unknown to themselves.

What was this peculiar spirit, what the character which it formed, and what the principles which it developed? Especially what were they as contrasted with those of the Jesuit?

The freedom and independence of the individual man characterized the Puritan, as obedience and dependence distinguished the Jesuit. It was not, however, a lawless freedom, but a liberty implied in that separate responsibility, which each man holds to himself and to his God. The Puritan must judge of a law, to know why he must obey it. No authority and no organization steps between himself and his conscience. Hence, as he stands or falls for himself, he is independent in his bearing, self-relying in his character, and marked in his individuality. This is not because he scorns the restraints of society or of law, but because he is overmastered by a restraint that is higher, — not that he despises authority, but that he reverences so deeply the authority that is highest of all. This feeling of responsibility, leads him to a personal and thorough investigation, an investigation which is not content till it has tested every question at the highest tribunal. He calls in question every truth, not because he is skeptical by nature, but that he may distinguish the True from the False. He must examine all Truth. He questions his own being, the powers of his own soul, the existence and character of God, the authority of conscience, the reason of this or that duty, the evidence of a Divine Revelation, the genuineness of the text, the exactness of its meaning. He calls in question the tenure of kings and magistrates, the right by which they bear the sword, the use or abuse of the power entrusted to their hands. When he is convinced, no man believes so strongly, for he is strong in the might of his own convictions; no man so reverent, for he has worshipped in the immediate presence of Truth. Hence, in action, he is efficient, direct and daring. He is efficient, not because he has been broken into mechanical habits by the drilling of years, but because he must do the bidding of his conscience and his Judge. He is direct, because the word of the Lord within him bids him to go, and he is daring, because he fears him only “who can destroy both body and soul.” The freedom and "the private judgement" of the Puritan do not, however, isolate him from his fellow-men, nor hinder him from acting in unison with others. His convictions consent to the value of earthly and spiritual societies, and his conscience compels him to sacrifice to their order and well-being, his selfish and private interests. It is true, he is not taken into an organization, as an inert atom, that receives its life from the central law of the whole, but he himself consecrates to his family, his country, and the church, all that he can do or suffer. Hence, in society is he stronger than any other man, because he contributes the strength of an independent intellect and an individual will. A union of elements, like this, is as much mightier than that of less independent spirits, as one of Cromwell's regiments was stronger than a Russian brigade. But if the organization becomes tyrannical or corrupt, then is it disowned as untrue to itself, and no longer binding on the man. It is reformed, if possible, by lawful means, or it is overthrown to make room for another and a better society. As the condition of man is ever changing, so, in his view, should organizations change. For this reason, the Puritan believes in no fixed institutions, to be retained as petrified memorials of the past, but in those which are ever growing into a more perfect life, and which adapt themselves to the changing wants of man. Hence is he by nature a Reformer. He is intent upon changing old laws, old institutions, and old habits that they may meet new exigencies and the new characters of those for whose benefit they exist.

Thus far have we considered the principles and the genius of these opposite systems. We will next inquire what has been the actual influence of each on systems and schools of education.
