  <title>Chapter 12 Conclusion | The Educational Systems of the Puritans and Jesuits Compared</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This book was a real disappointment. It was interesting in parts, but it didn’t tell me much of anything about the educational system of the Jesuits. It seems like Noah Porter was and is considered to be something of a crank, and that’s how he comes off in this essay." />

<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 12</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>But if our argument should fail altogether to excite any apprehension of the danger to be feared from Jesuit seminaries and Jesuit intrigues, it cannot fail to illustrate the immense power over society that is exerted by the higher institutions of learning, and to establish the fact beyond all question, that to endow and foster such institutions is one of the first duties of Christians to their generation. We have seen how at a critical period in the history of the past, the glorious work of free thought and Protestant reform was arrested by a deliberate plan to take possession of the youth of Europe, and turn their minds in a wrong direction. We have seen how the plan was carried into execution by a splendid scheme of educational influences, such as the world has never seen besides. We have seen the same system survive for centuries, and ready to act with efficiency wherever its presence was required, and ever ready to make its presence necessary — rising from defeat with new energy, husbanding its resources, and preparing for a new life when in banishment and disgrace — and still alive, ready to furnish teachers wherever they are desired, and to found institutions in anticipation of future need. We have seen also what it has accomplished. It has in fact educated generations of youth to do its bidding, and made them, willing or unwilling, the instruments of its own purposes. It has made the laws, controlled the politics and decided the religion of Europe for centuries. It has decided the principles, formed the dispositions, and even regulated the manners and fashions of whole generations of the rich, the noble, and the powerful. It has accomplished all this, simply because it has controlled the higher education of these generations.</p>
<p>In view of these lessons concerning what may be done by the higher institutions of learning, we are summoned to contemplate the condition of society among ourselves. At the East it is most flexible, ready to be moulded in each of its generations by the influences that are centred in our colleges and higher schools, and ready also to feel in all its separate portions any change in the men, who, by their knowledge, their modes of instruction, their principles, and their piety, give character to these colleges and schools. At the East the wants of these colleges are loud and pressing. These wants are the last to be appreciated by the Christian public. The claims which they urge rest with equal weight on thousands of the benevolent, each of whom has some immediate objects on which to bestow his benefactions, which seem to him to have a more direct relation to the improvement and evangelization of man.</p>
<p>At the West, society is yet to be formed. There, in the process of being united into a great empire, are minds of astonishing energy, and hearts of fire, that need to be taught, and guided, and restrained. The rapidity with which this empire is rushing up into an organized structure can find no likeness in the history of man. Old habits, old institutions, old laws, and old manners present but few hindrances to new impressions and new influences. Never was the need of education so pressing, never was its power for good so full of promise. Never was there an opportunity so easily, so quickly, and at so slight an expense, to give to millions of men a free Protestant and Christian education, and in so doing to decide their destiny.</p>
<p>Were there no danger from the Jesuits, there is danger from barbarism, fanaticism and infidelity; danger that is imminent and appalling. It is not enough to send tracts, Sunday schools, and even preachers to meet this exigency and avert these dangers. There must be the expenditure of tens of thousands, and it may be millions of money, in founding religious colleges and seminaries, which shall be strong enough in intellect and other resources, to do for Western society what the Jesuits did for Europe in the sixteenth century. If the review of their history should only excite our readers more fully to appreciate the value and the power of the Protestant institutions of this country, it will not have been written in vain.</p>
