<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Advantages of Protestant Schools</h1>
<p>First of all, the pupil in the Protestant school is far more likely to be self-developed and self-relying. His spirit in all his studies is a spirit of freedom. Hence his constant inquiry. What is the use of this or that study? What end is proposed in this or that painful mechanical training? When at last he learns to appreciate its value, he gives himself to it with a self-sustaining energy, which often accomplishes wonderful results. If he cannot supply the defects which arise from his earlier negligence, he may far surpass the more finished scholar in the mental energy and ready tact with which he applies his acquisitions to their actual uses, and especially may he surpass him in the elasticity with which he continues to study both books and men through a long professional life. Studies pursued with this kind of eagerness, and acquisitions sought after with such an awakened and cheerful spirit, are gained at less expense of toil, with less wasting of the spirit, and are also retained more freshly in the memory, than under a system of constraint and mechanism. If less knowledge is gained, and an inferior power is attained, what is gained is worth more to the scholar, and is likely to be worth more to the world. The pressure and over-mastering presence of an eminent teacher, under a system in which every thing is directed by the master, and constant reference is made to his will, represses the independence of the pupil, and forbids those struggles of his own, which, though awkward, and feeble, and unsuccessful at first, are as essential to a vigorous intellectual activity, as are the feeble essays of the bird newly fledged, to the strong pinions and the unwearied flight of the full-grown eagle. The hardness, the finish, and the perfect adjustment of the completest armor, may cripple and confine the frame for which it is fitted. The spirit and the entire regime of the Jesuit college forbid the acting of the pupils on each other. They are indeed invited to vie in the class-room, and to struggle for superiority in the labors of the closet; but the free and reciprocal action of character and intellect, in circles formed by the students themselves, is unknown. This, which marks the college or university life as an era so important in the intellectual history of an English or American student, is a thing unknown to the Jesuit seminary. It is contrary to the spirit of the order, to the very genius of the system. In the Jesuit college, the training, the influence, the very atmosphere of the place must proceed from the teacher. He must direct every motion in the establishment by his hand, and be present in every part by his eye. If he were able, he would search every closet and inspect every desk, nay, he would mould each rising thought, and form or repress each luxuriant emotion. He knows not the wisdom of leaving his pupil alone, of trusting him to his own energies, and of leaving him to his own responsibility. His college resembles an old French garden, of which the walls are smoothly cut, the turf is closely shorn, the walks are hard and polished, the plants abound in leaf, and flower, and fruit; but every leaf, bud, and branch has felt the hand and the shears. The Protestant college, on the other hand, is a modern English garden, in which nature and art conspire together with a harmonious grace; and though nature may sometimes rebel against art, or outgrow her watchful care, and here and there we discern neglect, yet we do not hesitate which to prefer.</p>
<p>The Jesuit college will train to erudition, the Protestant to independent thought. It will be the aim of the one to furnish its pupils with a knowledge of what men have thought and accomplished. The other will train them to inquire what is now to be believed, and what is now to be done. The one will give his pupil the history of opinions and arguments in the past, and will instruct him to make the future like the past. The Jesuit lives in the past, he adores and reverences the men and institutions that are gone by, with the blended enthusiasm of the scholar and the devotee. The Protestant will discipline his student to know what is true and useful for the present generation, and how the men of this generation are to be led to receive it. The one will only look backward, to make the future an exact transcript of the past. The other is ready to concede to the present and the future their claims.</p>
<p>Their methods and aims in reasoning will be different. The one system will train its pupils to investigate Truth. The other will discipline its scholars to defend opinions. The one will make philosophic thinkers, the other acute and skillful advocates. The one will proceed on the assumption that every doctrine may be examined to its foundations — that new discoveries and new arguments are to be allowed their lawful weight in the re-examination of long-acknowledged dogmas. The other assumes the position that certain opinions are true, that they are not to be examined for inquiry, but only for defense. It will render its pupils acute logicians, able and adroit reasoners, skillful debaters, and it may be, puzzling sophists, but it will guard them from a too thorough scrutiny of the facts and premises on which the superstructure is reared.</p>
<p>The method in which the students will prosecute the sciences of nature will be affected by the spirit of the opposite systems. The Jesuit will train erudite students, careful observers and admirable expounders of truths already received. The Protestant will be more likely to start a new theory, to invent a new method, or make a new discovery. The attitudes and expectations with which the two will present themselves before nature, and contemplate her hidden mysteries, will naturally tend to these opposite results.</p>
<p>The Puritan and the Jesuit instructors will teach history very differently. Supposing they are equally honest and fair in their representation of the events and facts of history, how different will be the principles by which they will explain these facts! In the eye of the Jesuit, what are the usurpations of the Spanish monarchy over the free and independent spirit that once animated its spirited people, and haunted its ancient mountains? They are the lawful and righteous repression of tendencies dangerous to the crown and the church; the summary destruction of rebellious tendencies against holy and venerable authority. What are they in the view of the Protestant and the Puritan? They are the tyranny of the priestly and kingly power united, whose symbol and agent is the inquisition. What, in the view of the Jesuit, is the noble resistance of the Low Countries against Spain? and what their free and tolerant spirit? What does he think of the free movements of the gentry and citizens of France? What of the long and painful struggle against prerogative in England, by which the great charter of human rights was wrested, fragment by fragment, from the iron grasp of power, and at the cost of blood on the battlefield, of the sighing of the prisoner in the dungeon, and of debate in the stormy senate-house? And what are all these struggles in the judgment of the Protestant historian? How different must be the estimate of these events by these two classes of teachers! With what opposite feelings will the two train their pupils to regard the same occurrences and the same individuals! How diverse will be the views of each, concerning the plans and purposes of God, concerning the developments of His Providence, concerning the progress of society, and the means of its ultimate perfection! With what opposite views will they regard the martyrs to liberty, and the great and good who have contended against power and wrong! With what a different spirit of heroism and faith will each animate his pupils, in view of the great events which have made Europe, and England and the United States what they are! In what opposite directions will the youthful enthusiasm of the pupils of each be directed! How will this ethereal element be shaped and hardened either into bitter prejudices or generous principles! To what different movements in society will each attach themselves, with their youthful ardor and their confirmed and settled principles!<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>We do not believe that the Jesuit will think it wise to array himself or his instructions against republican principles and institutions. It is far more probable that he will now and then astonish himself and his pupils, by the intensity of his republican sympathies. But he will never dare to study closely the struggles by which free principles have been developed, nor to examine the relative position which the Romish and Protestant parties have taken in these contests. But it is not unlikely that he may confess his admiration for institutions under which the people are free, if the people will be induced to obey the church. He may find it easier to bribe a demagogue or to manage a party, than to flatter or frighten a monarch. The Pope may yet become the noisiest demagogue which the world has ever seen, and marshal the democracy under a new banner indeed, but for the old conflict with the thrones of Europe. If the Jesuit can serve him in this enterprise, it will be nothing new. That, however, the Jesuit will be a hearty friend to those principles of independent thought, and private judgment, and personal responsibility, which are the strength and security of republican institutions, is impossible. Should he attempt to teach them, he could not succeed. His very nature and being revolt against them.</p>
<p>The relation of Reason to Faith, is one thing with the Jesuit, and quite another with the Protestant. The one will continually impress his pupil with a sense of the impotence and the blindness of the human intellect, when employed upon moral and religious truth. He will frighten him with a history of its dismal wanderings, he will confuse him by its conflicting arguments, and, if need be, will drive him to hopeless perplexity and despair, that he may lead him to the refuge of authority; and having made him a convert to authority, will dexterously substitute the authority of the church for the authority of the Scriptures — the authority of man for the authority of God. The Protestant teacher will show him that Reason is never hostile to Faith, but that by the very arguments which she suggests, and the inquiries which she awakens, she conducts the soul up to the very portals of Faith; — that the tasking of the powers in the service of Reason, and the awakening of the energies to grapple with her problems, is the best preparation to the full understanding and the hearty reception of the mysteries of Revelation.</p>
<p>Religion, as taught and exhibited in the two classes of institutions, will wear a different aspect. If we suppose the teachers to be equally sincere and equally intent upon forming their pupils to Christian piety, it will be obvious that they will inculcate a very different kind of religion. The religion of the one rests upon authority. It summons to set and prescribed devotions, which are insisted on as being of the utmost consequence. Fastings and vigils, penance and confession, are not the signs but the substance of devoted piety, and in proportion as these are increased is piety fostered, and the soul blessed. Every thing that exalts the church, the sacraments, and the priesthood, and that prostrates the devotee in the completest subjection to the interests and requirements of the church, is regarded with peculiar honor. The rights of the church are never questioned, its authority is never to be arraigned before any tribunal — its being and its authority are both taken for granted. To question is to rebel, to inquire is to show a perverse and wicked spirit. The application of religion to the life, to the formation of the temper for heaven; the direction of the energies to render man blessed here, and the world as nearly like heaven as is possible; all this is acknowledged to be important, but these ends are to be secured by the church, and it is by performing the services which the church enjoins, and by obeying the direction of the priesthood, that man will bless himself and his race.</p>
<p>The pupil may be attracted by this system of Faith. He may fulfill its services with zeal, and bend or break his spirit to all its requirements. He may be learned, accomplished, and devout, and display in himself the most amiable and attractive specimen of a Catholic devotee. Or he may be repelled by it. His daring spirit may cherish doubts which he dare not utter, but which will rankle like a barbed arrow within his bosom. He may be disgusted by those devotions which seem to him wearisome and hollow, but through their monotonous and weary round he is still forced to drag himself from day to day. He may loathe a system, which bids him renounce his reason in order to cherish his faith, and abhor a religion which does not lay its strong grasp on his convictions of what is true and right and binding — and come forth a heartless, faithless, and scoffing Infidel or Atheist, outwardly courteous to the church and the priesthood, but inwardly despising and loathing both, with all the energy and spirit which make him a man.</p>
<p>The religion of the Puritan college comes to the pupil to confer with him concerning his duty to himself and to his God. The service which it requires of him is a reasonable service. It calls him to the only right and worthy employment of the powers which make him a man — to the consecration of his living soul to his Creator and to his race. It enjoins upon him the duties of devotion, of self-denial, of sobriety, and of temperance, because these all commend themselves to his convicted judgment and his better feelings. It encourages him to attain the highest perfection in intellect, in character, and in all real graces and accomplishments, as a religious duty. It holds before him the example of Christ, as a beneficent Redeemer of man, by a life of active love, and this is the model by which it attracts and commands, and not the legend of some illuminated saint, with its absurd imaginings, its offensive asceticism, and its sickening experiences. It sends him to this Redeemer, to confer directly with him concerning his sins and his temptations, instead of directing him to the Holy Virgin to repeat his “Ave Maria, ora pro nobis.” It accustoms him to the Scriptures as to a book that will task and invigorate his intellect, that will kindle his better feelings, and elevate and purify his imagination. It does not exalt the sacred book to a mysterious idol, into whose inner mysteries the profane may not intrude, and whose oracular responses the priesthood alone can interpret.</p>
<p>This religion may sometimes be very imperfectly taught. It may be narrowly, inconsistently, and ungracefully exhibited. It may fail to gain the heart, and to win over the man. His passions, his pride, and his self-will, may all arm him against it. But he knows in his conscience and in his honest convictions, that it is true and binding, and that the book which it reveals is from God.</p>
<p>To those who, like ourselves, look upon the Romish system as a system of dangerous and fatal error, as a monstrous incubus, stifling and oppressing the gospel of Christ, no place can be so dangerous to the young as a Jesuit college, every exercise of which is made to assume a religious aspect, and to exert a religious influence. With the most favorable judgment of this religious influence, it will be likely either to gain the pupil to the Catholic faith as a deluded devotee, or to harden him against all faith and feeling, as a hopeless unbeliever.</p>
<p>Were we to gather the combined result of the influence of a teacher, an institution or a scheme of education for a single view, that view would respect the influence of all these upon the character. If education is to be tested, we have only to inquire, what kind of men does it form? Education itself is not an end. The knowledge which it gives — the training which it imparts — the graces with which it adorns — the splendor with which it invests the man — are none of them the final end at which it aims. The mighty influence for which it prepares — the glorious triumphs of intellectual prowess which it insures — the splendid results in words or deeds which endure as the lasting memorials of its power — none of these are its great objects. The end and aim, is the manhood which it forms — the style of character which it produces — and the combined product of intellect and soul — of principles and habits which “fit a man to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously, all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war.”</p>
<p>If, then, from this point of view, we look at the considerations which have been suggested; if we possess ourselves strongly yet fairly of the differences between the systems represented by the words Jesuit and Puritan; if we see how these systems must be impersonated in the character of every teacher, and be more or less perfectly stamped upon his obedient pupil; if we remember that they will pervade, as it were, the very atmosphere of the institution, and be breathed by the pupil with his daily breath, we shall justly estimate the difference between the education which is received at the Puritan, and that which is acquired at the Jesuit seminary. Every pupil who is sent to a school or a college is met by the <em>genius loci</em>, which is quite as influential and decisive in forming the character and in moulding the man, as the knowledge or discipline which he receives. The judgments which he forms of books and men — the standard by which he tries his fellows, and to which he shapes himself — these take the hue and form which will never change, in that fermenting, joyous, hoping, ardent period. Let, then, a man imagine a Protestant teacher like Dr. Arnold — sympathizing yet firm — the companion yet the master of his pupils — modest yet confident — inquiring yet believing — liberal yet earnest — reverential yet reforming — rational yet religious — and then picture another teacher, as nearly like him, as a Jesuit could possibly be and yet remain true to his principles. How great would be the difference on points the most important, and how widely apart in their character, their history, and their whole influence, would the pupils become, which should be formed by each!</p>
<p>Tried by such a test, let these systems be judged.</p>
<p>We cannot but dwell on the truth, which has been already more than implied, that the education of a man has to do with something besides the intellect. The intellect is the instrument, but it is not the force, which wields and guides it to its uses. It is the strong bow of Ulysses, but not the single eye and steady arm which sends the arrow home to the rightly chosen mark. The principles, the character, the living man, have quite as much to do with the attainments made — and certainly have they as much to do with the uses to which they are applied — as the training of the intellect, however complete and splendid that training may be. If the intellect be not trained in harmony with a character rightly moulded, and which is formed in obedience to the methods and will of the Supreme, every attainment of the intellect makes the deficiency of the man more striking. Nay, its most splendid accomplishments are in one aspect but vicious deformities. The Jesuit denies to man the right training of his character. Nay, he denies to him a character at all; for he denies him the freedom and separate responsibility which are necessary to make a character possible. It is easy to improve the touch, and to strengthen the smell, by extinguishing the eyesight. It is possible to give to the eyes a marvelous acuteness, in discerning objects on the floor of the dungeon; but who would count accomplishments of this sort, purchased at such a cost, any better than the tokens of its greater loss, and the badges of its lower degradation?</p>
<p>It may be that the Protestant, in this new country, does not secure to his pupil all that might be desired in the highest perfection of erudition, or the most practiced acuteness in disputation; but he does not weaken the very principle of intellectual activity, and visit, as with the poison of death, the life of the soul. He gives him a force and vigor — a truth and freedom of character — which make him always a learner, and then sends him forth into a sphere of social existence which is fitted to stimulate him to effort, and to realize a noble manhood. He does not fix a frame in the earth, symmetrical in form and polished by art, to stand as the monument and trophy of his skill; but he plants a tree, and gives it room to grow.</p>

<li id="fn24"><p>The Jesuit <em>dare</em> not teach the History of Freedom, which is true history. For it is a history of the conflict of reason, of conscience and of right, against unlawful usurpations. He dare not teach the history of the progress of man, which is the history of the sublime unfoldings of the counsels of God; for he himself is committed against progress with all the energies, and the desperation too, of a giant battling with Heaven. The history which he teaches, if true in its dates and events, must be false and sophistical in its philosophy. It must be steeped in sophistry — craven in its cowardice— or brazen with conscious lies.
