<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 6</span> Protestant Institutions</h1>
<p>The limits of this essay will not allow us to trace the history and the influence of Protestant institutions and of Protestant systems of education. This history is familiar to our readers, and it is not necessary for the argument, that it be drawn out at length. We need only name the Protestant universities of Germany in their ancient and modern fame; the Prussian common school system, with the other similar systems to which it has given the impulse; the universities of Denmark, Sweden, and Scotland, with the parochial and domestic education of these countries: the English universities, for whose imperfections Protestantism is not responsible, and the college and school systems of the United States. In these institutions, those principles, which are the glory and strength of the Protestant interest, have been expounded and defended. From them have proceeded those influences which have made Protestant civilization, Protestant freedom, and Protestant piety, to be what they are. In them have been instructed and disciplined, Protestant children, to read and understand the Scriptures, and to act as independent members of the church and state. From their minor schools, as from innumerable crystalline points of light and order, have proceeded those influences which make the Protestant masses to differ from the Romish, as the sparkling and lifelike marble differs from the earthy limestone. From the higher institutions have been derived those statesmen, who have been educated to govern citizens more or less free, — who have for themselves been independent students, and have formed an independent character. From them have issued those preachers of Christian truth, who have been led directly to the word of God as the fountain of truth, and directly to God himself as the object of their worship. Should these institutions cease to exist, or should they abandon their principles, and their methods of instruction, then would Protestantism in its freedom, its science and its religion, cease to exist.</p>
<p>Two features of the Puritan system of education seem, however, to demand a special consideration.</p>
<div id="they-educate-the-masses" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.0.0.1</span> They Educate the Masses</h4>
<p>The principles of the Puritan require him to educate the masses; those of the Jesuit, compel him to consider popular education as unnecessary and dangerous. Christianity, as understood by the Puritan, is based upon thought and reflection. The faith which is the condition of salvation, is a conviction of personal necessities, which is promoted by the cultivation of the intellect, and by the training of this intellect to a faithful dealing with itself. The moral and religious feelings are cherished by the clear perception of duties which can be understood, and of truths which commend themselves to every man’s conscience. The want of intellectual culture in any man, in any family or community, is both an occasion and sign of moral debasement and of religious error. No exactness of formal compliances, no abjectness of superstitious dread, no wildness of religious terror or rapture of religious joy, no blind devotedness to the will of a priesthood, are sufficient to prove an uninstructed people religious. The Puritan will not be content, till he has carried the Scriptures into every cottage, however humble its structure or poor its inmates; nor will he believe his duty to his God has been performed, till he has taught the inmates of that cottage to read and to comprehend those Scriptures. Hence, wherever he builds a church, he erects a school-house, and the same faith which inclines him to do the one, compels him to do the other. To educate a whole people, is to obey in one most important point, the command of his Master to carry the gospel to all nations. This gospel cannot be received nor can it be retained, certainly, it cannot be fully comprehended and fervently loved except the intellect be instructed. As this gospel is preached to the poor, there must go with it that education for the poor which the gospel presupposes, in order that it may be received, and which it will be sure to create and to cherish wherever it is received. This is not merely a theory of the Puritan, held as a part of his speculative system. It has become a fact wherever his system has been received. No fact is more clearly and vividly written upon the page of history, than that all those countries in which Puritan principles have prevailed, have been distinguished for successful efforts to educate the whole people.</p>
<p>The Jesuit does not believe in popular education. The masses of men, those who toil in the lower ranks of society, are not, in his view, fit to be educated. To teach them to read and to think, will only make them uneasy and seditious in the state, and faithless and disobedient in the church; nor is it necessary that they should think in order to believe. Faith in the priest and the church can be exercised without the education of the school, and a compliance with the prescription of the church does not require a thinking man. Hence the Jesuit not only is not impelled to educate the lower orders of society, but he prefers that they should be left in ignorance, or be taught by the priest the little that it is safe for them to know. The theory of the Jesuit has been realized in fact. Notwithstanding the zeal, the devotedness, and the success, with which the order have given themselves to the work of education, they have never sought to instruct the masses of any single country. It was never a part of their plan to train the lower orders of society. With all the apparatus for this purpose which they have had at their command, with the rulers of Europe under their influence, and with Pope and priesthood ready to further their projects, with wealth and time and men all at hand, they never originated a project to educate the people. They have never regarded these projects except with hostility, yielding to them only when forced to do it, and connecting themselves with them, only when they had become too formidable to be let alone.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<div id="their-religious-character" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.0.0.2</span> Their Religious Character</h4>
<p>We name also a second feature of the Puritan system. It is earnestly religious. The Puritan educates mankind, not to develop the race for this life only, but to fit them for the life to come. His aim is not to bring out splendid triumphs of intellectual power, nor to advance the sciences to their highest perfection, nor to increase the comforts and elegancies of life, nor to elevate and adorn society. It is not to serve any or all of these objects as ends but chiefly as they relate to a higher end, in the preparation of man for a happier and holier life hereafter. Hence his whole system of training is directed to a religious object. All his institutions are animated by a religious spirit. The motives, the restraints, and the hallowed influences of the Christian faith, are prominently recognized at every step of the education which he gives, and are largely employed in controlling the passions, and in forming the character. The Puritan system has no sympathy with, nor relation to, those infidel and atheistic systems, which, forsooth, because science is not faith, and learning is not theology, banish all religion from the school-room and the college, or render to faith that polite but heartless courtesy, which is more dangerous than to ignore faith altogether.</p>
<p>But, while on the one hand, the Puritan scheme is earnestly religious, while it rejects with abhorrence all those systems which seek to train the young without the aid of faith — it is not religious in the abject sense in which the Jesuit system is, and must be. The Puritan has that confidence in the foundations of his faith, which leads him to give to science an independent activity, and to prosecute every kind of study in a fearless spirit. His motto is — if religion will not endure the searching test of free thought, she is not worth retaining; if science can annihilate the claims of faith, or invalidate her records, let science do her utmost. He utters this, not because he doubts, but because he believes the more strongly. For in his view, the God who requires faith, is also the God who has made science necessary. He who has revealed himself to man’s believing eye, has also declared the eternal truths of philosophy. The spheres for these two movements of the mind are never inconsistent, yet are they in their nature independent. Each has its own laws, yet the laws of each are uttered by the same lawgiver. They revolve, not as a wheel within a wheel, but as two separate circles, do they conspire together. Hence, each may, nay each must^ be studied by its lighi, and stand by its own principles. The Jesuit, on the other hand, introduces religion into his schools to watch each movement of thought, and to pass judgment upon every conclusion of science. He will not leave science alone, not even for a moment. If she move at all, she must move as a slave, chained within prescribed limits, and forbidden to use her appropriate freedom. Hence is it that thought is distrusted; reasoning is perpetually reproved; and the reason and conscience of man are placed in an unnatural conflict with each other, vexing each the other by a perpetual strife: Hence, religion is hated and feared; the reason of man is prostrate; and that faith to which science would have willingly ap- proved her proudest achievements, if she had leave to think and search with freedom, must content herself with the scanty products of a constrained and reluctant service.</p>

<li id="fn22"><p>We quote as apposite the impassioned words of Victor Hugo. “You (Jesuits) claim the liberty to instruct. For some centuries you have held in your hands, at your discretion, at your school, under your ferule, two great nations—Italy and Spain, illustrious among the illustrious; and what have you done with them? I am going to tell you. Thanks to you; Italy, of which no one can think nor even pronounce her name without inexpressible filial grief—Italy, that mother of genius and of nations, which has diffused over the whole world the most astonishing productions of poetry and art—Italy, which has taught our race to read, does not today know how to read herself! Yes, Italy has, of all the states of Europe, the smallest number of native inhabitants who are able to read! Spain; magnificently endowed—Spain, which received from the Romans her first civilization, from the Arabians her second civilization, from Providence, and in spite of you, a world — America — Spain has lost — thanks to you, thanks to your brutal yoke, which is a yoke of degradation — Spain has lost that secret of her power which she received from the Romans, that genius in the arts which she received from the Arabs, that world which God gave her. And in exchange for what you made her lose, what has she received? She has received the <em>Inquisition</em>.”<a href="protestant-institutions.html#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
