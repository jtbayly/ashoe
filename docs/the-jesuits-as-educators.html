  <title>Chapter 3 The Jesuits as Educators | The Educational Systems of the Puritans and Jesuits Compared</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This book was a real disappointment. It was interesting in parts, but it didn’t tell me much of anything about the educational system of the Jesuits. It seems like Noah Porter was and is considered to be something of a crank, and that’s how he comes off in this essay." />

<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> The Jesuits as Educators</h1>
<p>The most important services for which the Jesuits were trained, were those of missionary labor, the confessional, diplomacy, and education. This last was superior in importance to all the others. It was foremost in the view of the founders of the society, and it became the mightiest agency that was wielded by the body. The state of education in the church had been low. The principle of dependence for salvation on a priestly work, and on priestly authority, had wrought its appropriate result in intellectual stagnation. Literature and art adorned the high places of society; but earnest thought and wakeful inquiry animated neither the pulpit nor the school. But when Protestantism began then did Thought awake. The sluggish and mechanical movements of society, its endurance of sensual and unlettered priests, and its unquestioning reception of authoritative dogmas were now at an end. Schools of learning sprung into being, in which the Scriptures were studied in their original languages, and the principles of the new faith were expounded by acute and eloquent professors. Other schools were multiplied to prepare the youth for their more advanced studies. The doctrine of Justification by Faith did not end with its application to the conscience. It drew after it the inference, that if every man must stand or fall by his personal faith in the gospel, then the intellect and the heart must understand and consent to this gospel. The consequences to Rome began to be alarming. The spirit of inquiry was moving within her enclosures. It would not be rebuked by authority. It would soon despise, and even loathe, an ignorant priesthood. If no schools were provided by the church, myriads would rush to those infected with heresy. To meet this crisis, the society of Jesus stood forth as an organized educational establishment, and it began with active zeal the work of training both teachers and pupils. Its Religious zeal, its proselyting fervor, its perfect discipline, its omniscient and omnipresent power, its control by a single mind, its unequalled facilities for making the skill, the art, and the science of one of its members, the possession of all, were combined and concentrated upon the work of educating the youth of Christendom, in order to hold them to their ancient Faith, or to turn them back from heresy. This they hoped to effect, in part, by occupying the awakened mind of Europe with the delights of classical learning, the graces of rhetoric, the subtleties of logic, and the labors of busy erudition, and thus diverting it from too active an interest in the truths of Protestantism. Then they would arm the defenders of Rome with a store of well-considered arguments, and train them to their skillful use. They aspired, also, to gain for the church a splendid fame for wisdom and learning. But most of all, did they aim, deliberately and steadily aim, to gain a personal influence over the youth of Europe, so as to be able to mould and use them at their will. They were an organized society, numerous yet compact, every where present, yet never beyond the reach or voice of their general. They selected their own instruments from their own seminaries, and they trained them too. Their energies were concentrated on the single object of becoming the ablest and the most attractive teachers of Christendom. If an able and influential college were needed in an important city, they could call one into being in a week, and furnish it with the teachers exactly fitted for the place. If a rival was to be set up to another already existing they could find, or make, abler and more attractive instructors than this possessed. The study of the best methods of instruction occupied their earnest attention. What they discovered they could test in a thousand ways; what they approved could be set in operation in their thousand school. All that one generation had learned could be secured for the next. For living teachers were all the while training living teachers. Thus did this society become one extended normal school. It invented and applied what we call by that name. At one period it prepared the schoolbooks for Catholic Europe. It edited and illustrated the classics. It stimulated its pupils by rewards, and prizes, and commemorations. It studied to make learning attractive. Its professors were patient and mild, artful and eloquent; yet learned, self-possessed, and rarely at fault. Their scholars were thoroughly trained, not merely in the heavier acquisitions of scholarship, but finished in its lighter accomplishments. The Jesuit schools were also severely religious. Their moral atmosphere was pure, their devotions were rigid, and their discipline exact. They were gratuitous. The instruction was imparted freely, not only to pupils of the Romish faith, but to all who chose to attend upon it. Provision was made for classes who would listen to the lectures of the teacher, but declined to submit themselves to the regime of the college. Three descriptions of pupils might be seen at every establishment. First, were the candidates for the society itself – those who offered themselves, or were persuaded by others, to try the hard yet attractive novitiate. Next, were the Romish pupils, who resorted to these renowned schools to acquire the learning and accomplishments which should fit them to serve the state or the church. Last, were the sons of Protestant parents, who could not resist the attractions of these thronged institutions. These last were not the least, as objects of interest and importance. The majority of these pupils, of all classes, would be men of commanding influence; not a few would be men of rank and wealth. Some of them would be electors of the empire, others, proud and haughty nobles, now and then would be present the heir to a throne. The few thousands in Europe at that period receiving an education, were the thousands, who, if lost to the church, would carry the masses of their dependents and retainers with them; who, if gained, would bind the next generation to Rome. Out of this mass of intellect and wealth and rank, the sagacious eye of the teacher selects one, who may be to the society a tower of strength, and forthwith he plies all his art to gain him. The eye that has once fastened upon its victim, never after releases him from its gaze, till it has charmed him within the magic circle and made him forever sure. Another is marked, as promising to be of the greatest service, by remaining separate from the order, while yet he shall be swayed by its influence. Every noble of the highest rank, every statesman of superior talents, who shall have a Jesuit for his confessor and friend, will through his conscience be so directed as to further the ends of the society and the politics of the Holy See. Another, an inquiring Protestant, is observed among the charmed hearers who hang upon the lips of an eloquent teacher. His eager yet self-relying spirit, his deferential yet unbelieving air, his fixed yet not unshaken principles, all mark him as a most attractive prize. To secure these prizes of various worth — to gain one half of these youths — the Jesuit has vast and ready resources. First of all, he can completely understand his man — can probe his heart, trace out his secret thoughts and note his actions, by those hundred eyes, through which he can see him in darkness, watch him when alone, and gaze upon him in sleep. He can summon to his aid and make the partners of his plans, a hundred or a thousand helpers, all of the same spirit with himself Through the resources of his extended organization, he can spread his net in the remotest distance. He can surprise his victim, by some unexpected and strange event which shall seem to answer his prayers, as the voice or vision of the Almighty.</p>
<p>It was with these resources that the members of this society, in the words of its Catholic historian, being “masters of the present by the men whom they had trained, and disposing of the future by the children who were yet in their hands, realized a dream which no one, till the times of Ignatius, had dared to conceive.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
