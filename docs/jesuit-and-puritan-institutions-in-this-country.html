  <title>Chapter 7 Jesuit and Puritan Institutions in this Country | The Educational Systems of the Puritans and Jesuits Compared</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This book was a real disappointment. It was interesting in parts, but it didn’t tell me much of anything about the educational system of the Jesuits. It seems like Noah Porter was and is considered to be something of a crank, and that’s how he comes off in this essay." />

<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> Jesuit and Puritan Institutions in this Country</h1>
<p>The Jesuit and Puritan institutions in all their varieties and gradations are already in existence in the United States. Both are likely to increase in their number, their resources, and their influence. What each have been in the past in their genius and power, we have already seen. We now ask, what are they at present and what are they to be in the future? What is, and what is to be, their character, and what their influence?</p>
<p>First, What are the actual peculiarities of these institutions as they exist in this country? What kind of discipline do they give, and what sort of men will they educate? These questions we propose to consider with candor. We would do justice to the excellencies and the defects of both of these systems. We would recognize the best examples of each, the best teachers, the best colleges, and the best results.</p>
<p>We warn our readers beforehand, that they must neither be surprised nor offended, if we concede certain points of superiority to the Jesuit institutions. Despotism in civil government, as all will own, presents some advantages over freedom. The administration of law may be more prompt, more energetic and impartial. Plans of conquest may be formed with greater sagacity and forecast, and they may be executed with completeness and energy. The glory of a nation in arts and letters may be more sedulously cherished, and every resource may be combined and directed to this one end with a skill and success which a freer government cannot imitate. And yet no wise and good man, on these accounts, prefers an absolute government, to one that is free.</p>
<p>The Jesuit system, as we have seen, is in all its features, a thorough despotism. It is a despotism far more dreadful than any civil or ecclesiastical system; for it takes into its iron grasp the intellect and soul of a living man. It seeks to crush and break in pieces the will which God gave to him when he made him a person, and to mar and wrong the conscience, with which he has made him responsible to himself. In its fundamental principle it commits <em>“the sin against the life of the soul”</em> by robbing it of that freedom which its Creator has made the condition of its full development, and its true well-being. It commits also a wrong against the Creator, by taking to that soul “the place of God,” not only with respect to its external movements, and the conditions of its outward being, but also with respect to its very thoughts and feelings. It ought not to surprise us, if this monstrous usurpation should bring with it certain advantages. We should rather expect that a system which has an access so complete to the internal machinery which it seeks to direct, and a power so irresistible over its minutest spring and wheel, would train the mind to a certain kind of perfection which no other system can realize. But this perfection, as will appear, is in some of its aspects a monstrous imperfection. Its proudest results, as they are based upon a sin against the rights and freedom of the individual man, are certain to be attended with imperfections as striking as the principles are false upon which the training has been conducted. While, then, we may expect to find certain peculiar excellencies in the Jesuit schools, we ought not to forget at what a vast expense they are purchased. Nor ought we, while in all honesty we own them to be excellencies, to be less honest in our exposure of the fatal defects under which they labor.</p>
<p>Let us, then, enter the best Jesuit college which may be supposed to exist, or to be likely to exist, in this country, — one which is situated the most favorably, which is furnished the most amply with conveniences and apparatus, which is manned by the ablest and the most accomplished teachers, and enrolls the choicest selection of pupils. Let us compare it with one of our best Protestant or Puritan colleges.</p>
