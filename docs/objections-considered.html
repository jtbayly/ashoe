<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 11</span> Objections Considered</h1>
<p>Should it be objected against the tenor and conclusion of our argument, that the views which we have taken of Jesuit in comparison with Protestant scholars is altogether too unfavorable to the latter, we reply, we draw no comparison between these scholars as they are contrasted in Europe. Our argument has to do with the few superior teachers which the Jesuits have furnished to this country. The superiority which we concede to these last is limited to a narrow range, and is confined to but few branches. Within this range, and in these branches, they show the fruits of a labor to which we are slow to submit, and of a training such as only older institutions and older countries can appreciate or enforce. Out of these limits, and for most of the purposes for which an education is sought, these teachers are inferior, and perhaps contemptible. No man who understands the entire bearing of the culture that is given by such men, apart from its religious influences even, would think of sending a son to a Jesuit college, if he wished to fit him to take an honorable position as an American and a free citizen. He might well desire a Jesuit instructor to teach his boy to write or to speak Latin, to argue with logical dexterity, to become an acute and accomplished mathematician, but if he desired to send him where he would be trained to think and feel like a man, he would not expose him to the influence of those whose ideal of manhood is realized in the sophist, the diplomatist, the driveller, and the devotee.</p>
<p>It may be insisted, again, that the Jesuit schools in this country, and the Jesuit teachers, are too contemptible, for ignorance and squalor, to be feared; that it offends one’s gravity to hear encomiums bestowed on an education so shallow and superficial as that which these teachers generally bestow. Our reply is, it is true, very true, that the majority of these institutions are, and always will be, inferior and superficial, because the object of the Jesuits is not to educate, but to use the mass of its scholars; it is not to enlighten, but to proselyte those brought within its reach. Not many years since the emperor of Austria was heard to say to the students of the University of Vienna, “Austria does not seek to train accomplished scholars, but obedient subjects.” Such a sentiment the Jesuit would utter with a fullness of meaning and a fervor of feeling to which even the emperor was a stranger. Yet still it is true, on the other hand, that as the system requires some accomplished students, so it knows how to train them; and that to argue from the inferiority of many or most of the schools and teachers in this country, that they have no schools and teachers of the highest rank, is to display a scantiness of information and of logic, at which even the Jesuit might wonder.</p>
<p>Besides, it is to be remembered, that the call for a superior education at their schools is at present most limited; that an inferior and superficial culture is the most grateful to that portion of our countrymen whom they can bring within their reach; that in Europe there are great interests at stake, which call for the ablest intriguers, the most dexterous diplomatists, and the profoundest statesmen which the society can furnish; and that we may be well assured, that if able men and accomplished scholars can here find work to do, they will be found or trained. That system, which has men at its command who can make themselves felt in the courts of Europe, which has the diplomatic experience and wisdom of centuries at its service; that society, that within twenty years, has almost revolutionized some of the oldest universities of Europe, is not to be dismissed with a sneer at its deficiency in able men.</p>
<p>It may yet be urged that the present age is too enlightened to be imposed on by the artifices of the Jesuits, and that the circumstances of the present century are very different from those which at the period of the Reformation, presented so fine a field for their efforts and their triumph. We own that the present age is enlightened. “We believe that the Jesuit now contends with a foe that is mightier than those with which he has grappled in other days. But we would not be so simple as to forget that when man has to do with religion, he puts out the light that is given of God, sooner than in respect to any other subject whatever, and that however shrewd or far-seeing a generation of men may prove themselves in respect to all things else, they may at the same time in religion be bigots or fools. On this subject men either think so little as to allow the thinking to be done for them on the easiest terms by the priests of unbelief, or the priests of a hierarchy; or on the other hand, the subject is so serious, and conscience can awaken such terrors, that they freely bend their necks to a papal asceticism, or bow their souls before a pompous and self-enthroned authority. Who does not see in these passing years, that an increased fondness for <em>&quot;church principles&quot;</em> has been gathering strength in almost all Protestant denominations, till it has become the fashion of the times: that as one result Rome has gained considerable recruits from more than one denomination, and made of accomplished and ingenuous youth, trained by Protestant firesides, her devoted and credulous sons? Who does not know that influences are diffused through the channels of an imaginative literature, which are fitted to abuse the religious aspirations of the young, and their trusting confidence, till they shall be ready to give themselves up to any thing that bears on its front the charmed word authority, that appeals to the spirit of reverence, or that displays a rigid adherence to the forms of worship? It is a fact not to be disguised, that from circles in our country”the nearest to unbelief,&quot; sensitive and bewildered minds have rushed in an agony of doubt to find rest in that creed which is most positive in its assertions, and with a convulsive grasp after authority of some sort, have submitted to the authority of Rome. We have seen the stoutest skeptics transformed in an instant to the most dogmatic believers, the extremest unbelievers receive without scruple the most absurd dogmas, and even delight in childish legends, which a few months previous they would have rejected with loathing and disgust. Against influences like these, it is idle to expect that education will guard her most favored sons. They are influences which education itself creates, and which the educated only feel. They are confined to the circles of refinement and culture, but there they are all-powerful and all-pervading. They are created by the enlightenment of the age, and yet have a potency which makes their victims the veriest bond-slaves of their peculiar prejudices.</p>
<p>The argument, that the illumination of the age is a security against the influence of the Jesuits, is refuted by facts that can neither be denied nor disputed. In Germany, among the highest literary circles, there is a strong tendency in the direction already indicated, both among the Catholics and Lutherans. In England, these influences have gathered strength in the most ancient and renowned university in the kingdom; have induced a state of things in the church, and throughout the country, which if a prophet had foretold thirty years ago, he would have been counted mad. In this country the same current flows strongly and deeply, and in quarters where it is not generally suspected. Nay, in Germany, in England, and America, out of the very infidelity which has resulted from the illumination of the age, has sprung up, by a natural reaction, a disposition to favor a factitious order and authority.</p>
<p>It may be contended, indeed, that these movements affect the educated alone, while the middling and lower classes are moving with a strong and swelling current towards freedom in the church and in the state. This is true, and we argue from it the final triumph of freedom and of truth. But the triumph will not come without a struggle, and in that struggle Jesuit teachers may yet exert a powerful influence. What if the influences to which we have alluded prevail only in the higher circles of society. These circles give the fashion to those which are lower, and fashion, especially when she assumes the downcast look and the modest robe of the religious devotee, is all-powerful, not less in a free republic than in a stable monarchy. It is preeminently the law of modern society that intellect and wealth govern the world. Let the educated and rich in our own country be infected with any prejudices, however absurd, and fall into any fashions, however ridiculous, and the masses will be sure to follow. Our freedom in the church and in the state furnishes no security against the result; it only presents fewer hindrances to the rapidity and certainty of the consequences.</p>
<p>It is again contended that a free press and free discussion are omnipotent against all these dangers. Indeed, how was it in Belgium? After the revolution of 1830, four daily journals made their appearance. Within a year they dwindled away, and very soon were abandoned or sold to the opposite party. The pulpit thundered against them — absolution was refused to their patrons. Even the persons employed at their offices were put under the ban. ‘But Catholic Belgium is not Protestant America.’ True, but let Jesuit teachers train Protestant editors, and what would be the result? Let them mould in whole or in part, the intelligent youth of a city, a county, or a state, and what would be the consequences? Or if so complete an influence is not to be anticipated, let there exist in any city, or county, or state among us, an influential body of Catholic laity, educated and filling high positions in social, commercial, and professional life, and what will be the courage or independence of the journals which they patronize? Even now, when questions merely political arise, in which Catholic votes are to be humored or bought, how courteous and flattering does every editor become towards the Church of Rome; how reverential to its priesthood, how incredulous in respect to its enormities, and how ready to surrender the best established principles of republican freedom to its dictation. In New York city, strenuous efforts were made to introduce separate Catholic schools, and to support them from the public treasury; and the Protestant press was extensively committed in favor of the project, plainly inconsistent as it is with every principle on which any public school system can be based. In Massachusetts a charter was sought for a Jesuit college at Worcester,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> to which Catholics only should be admitted, and though this provision was opposed to the principles and practice of the State in chartering public seminaries, yet it was sustained by a large minority, and urged by influential journals of all political parties. Nothing can be more clear from the history of the past, than that whenever a question has arisen in our country which has affected the Romish Church, the powerful influence of the Romish priesthood has been felt on the public press, hushing it into silence, or bribing it to base compliances and hollow flatteries. Nothing is more certain, than that in the future, as the number, the wealth, and the intellectual culture of the Catholics shall in- crease, the secular press will be less reliable as a defence against the evils of the Romish system, if it does not become its ally. Nay, even in our own time, it has happened more than once that the consecration of a Romish cathedral, or the founding of a Jesuit college, have been hailed by Protestant editors in language the most ridiculously fulsome, disgusting, and extravagant. It is notorious that in certain sections of our land, the liberal party in religion has, through the fear of the imputation of bigotry, been willing to believe all that is good of Rome, and been foremost to disbelieve all that is bad; has, through the “bigotry of its liberality,” been almost ready to send its daughters to a convent and its sons to a Jesuit seminary.</p>
<p>We are well aware that our arguments and appeals will be denounced as the offspring of Protestant prejudice and bigotry. Such is the fashion of Romish writers in this country, especially of the Romish neophytes, whose chief weapon against every attack is either affected contempt for Puritan ignorance and rusticity, or pretended pity for Protestant heretics who are reserved for the wrath of God, or a ferocious blackguardism against the impertinent audacity that ventures to meddle with the church. Such is the habit of Romish writers, and it shows that they know the temper of their followers, and understand well what will best suit their tastes and influence their understandings. It would be well, however, for such men to reflect that Protestants are not ignorant that the Society of Jesus has been the object of suspicion and attack from influential men in the Church of Rome itself; that no worse things have been said of it by Protestants than have been said by Romanists themselves; that Romish ecclesiastics have, in all the generations of its history, directed against it their open attacks and their secret machinations; that Romish teachers have dreaded it as a rival, and detested it as an intriguer; that Romish authors, and Romish nobles and princes have combined together to crush it as dangerous, desperate, unprincipled, and treacherous — now a demagogue and then a regicide. The vicar of Christ himself has more than once placed upon it his foot, to be stung by its fangs when writhing in the death struggle.</p>
<p>We are Protestants indeed; we glory in the name. Surely as we stand upon this American soil, we have no reason to be ashamed of it. We do not repel the Romanist from our shores. We allow him to erect his churches, his schools, his colleges. We give him leave to circulate his Bible, his ponderous arguments, his annals for the learned, and his lighter tracts for the people. We ourselves go to Rome, to Spain, to Italy, to Austria, and claim there the same liberty. Our books are seized, and we ourselves are courteously led to the frontier, or shut up in a prison-house. Is there nothing in Protestantism of which to boast?</p>
<p>Doubtless we look at this subject with Protestant partialities and Protestant prejudices. It is natural that we should. But we desire to do full justice to all that is good in Romish piety and in Romish education. We would give to the scholars and the Christians of that church the highest praise that they deserve. Nay, if we must err at all, we would extol their excellencies, and be charitable to their defects. But we cannot be ignorant of the first principles of the Romish system, nor can we be blind to the legitimate consequences to which these principles lead. Still less can we fail to see that the Jesuit society, in respect to the principles on which it is based, the character which it would form, and the services for which it would fit the man, nay, even in respect to its notions of what Christianity and education are, is altogether opposed to the views which we hold of education, of manhood, of freedom, of the authority of reason, and of the first principles of the religion of Christ. Holding these views, and knowing too well the power of an organization so old, so experienced, so practiced in all the arts by which men are moved, working the mightiest agency in society — the religious hopes and fears of other men — and yet absolved itself from those hopes and fears, committed also with an untiring energy and perseverance to the interest of the Romish faith, we do but justice to our convictions, as we express our fears of its power, our abhorrence of its principles, and raise our voice of warning against its institutions.</p>
<p>To say that these fears and this dislike are only what is common from one religious sect towards another, and that all this earnestness is to be ascribed to the narrow influence of religious bigotry, is to say that one faith is as good as another, that there is no difference between the worship of Jehovah and of Juggernaut; no choice between a faith that justifies itself to the judgment and binds the moral nature, and one that offends the reason and shocks the conscience. To say that there is no danger in committing the training of a child to a Romish or Jesuit school, which is bound by all that is sacred in its convictions and consistent in its principles, to do what it can to proselyte that child to the faith of Rome, is to be ignorant, and foolish, and guilty.</p>

<li id="fn26"><p>See speeches of Mr. Hopkins, of Northampton, on the bill to incorporate the College of the Holy Cross in the city of Worcester, delivered in the House of Representatives, April 24th and 25th, 1849. <br /> <br />See also a review of the reports and discussions on the subject in Brownson’s Quarterly Review, 1849. It is worthy of especial notice, that the point on which the petitioners most insisted, and which was the ground of the rejection of their request, was the provision asked for, that <em>none but Catholics should be admitted to the privileges of the institution.</em> The superficial observer would argue from this, that the institution was not intended for proselyting purposes, and that the design of this provision was to preclude such an objection. It should be remembered, however, that in this country the Catholics for the present are most earnest to guard their children and youth against the liberalizing influences which are sure to follow from contact with Protestant minds. It is the first object with them to prevent such an intercourse. Hence their zeal to institute separate schools under the direction and control of the priesthood. Hence their determined purpose in some quarters to reject even a gratuitous education at the public school, and to educate the children of each parish in a separate establishment. <br /> <br />Another reason for this arrangement, may be the fear to expose to Protestant inspection the kind of instruction which is received from the lips of their teachers, the arguments by which the church is defended and Protestantism is assailed, as well as to expose to the light the services and discipline of their devotions. <br /> <br />Are we not required to suspect still more than this, that these institutions may be designed for the special service of “THE” Society, rather than for the general objects of the Romish church? If so, there is a double reason for secrecy and seclusion. <br /> <br />Since the above was written, the avowed hostility of Romish journals and of Romish ecclesiastics, to our public school system, as furnishing a place suitable for the education of the children of “the church,” and the active and simultaneous efforts to withdraw their children from free into parochial schools, have become more significant.<a href="objections-considered.html#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
