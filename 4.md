# 4. Their Influence in Arresting the Reformation

The question is often asked, what agency arrested the Reformation in its onward and apparently triumphant advances? How happened it, that all these advances were on a sudden arrested, and as by the mysterious fiat of Fate, the dividing line was fixed between the Catholic and Protestant sections of Europe, to remain till now almost precisely where it was drawn, thirty years after Luther had broken with Rome. The Catholic wonders as he looks back upon the tide of destructive lava which rushed down upon the church and threatened to desolate its fair domains, when, in a moment, its liquid waves are hardened into rock. No one who reflects upon the resources of the Jesuits can hesitate to pronounce them to be the cause, or can wonder at the greatness of the effects. Upon this point Catholic and Protestant historians have been singularly agreed. It is interesting to go back, and stand in the midst of the conflict, and be present in the councils of the leaders on the Catholic side. We are at the council of Trent, which had been called at the bidding of Catholic Europe, for the express purpose of devising an effectual remedy against the dangers that impended over the church. Its sessions had been protracted and adjourned for years. The Articles of Faith are at last agreed upon, and the attention of the council is now turned to the reformation of the church, that it may be saved from disgrace and ruin. The corruption of morals is allowed to be deplorable, and a knowledge that something efficient must be done. The Society of Jesus had then existed for nearly a quarter of a century. It had shown its capacity. It had developed and tested its resources. In view of what it had shown itself able to do, the council gave the church into its hands, for rescue and defense. It was as when Napoleon sent, as his last hope, the old Imperial guard into the desperate field at Waterloo. Says our historian, “It was required by the honor of the assembled church to propose and to accept efficacious measures, to extirpate the evil by its roots. The evil was confessed by all. All sought for the remedy with the same faith and the same earnestness. They believed it necessary to go to the source of the disorder, and to give the chief attention to education. A multitude of bishops demanded that the Society of Jesus should multiply every where its seminaries and its colleges. The Count of Lune, the ambassador of Philip II., was most thoroughly acquainted with the state of Germany and the Peninsula. The council interrogated him as to the measures which ought to be adopted. ‘I know only these two,’ replied he; ‘train good preachers, and propagate as far you can the Society of Jesus.’ Commendon, the Nuncio in Poland, when addressed in his turn expresses himself in the same terms, and reduced his opinion to writing that it might be sent to Rome. The ministers of the Emperor declare that the introduction of reform among the German clergy would be attended with many difficulties, but they add, and we translate from their very words, the Jesuits have shown to Germany what she can expect, for, by the probity of their life, and by their sermons, they have preserved and are even now preserving the Catholic religion. For this reason, it cannot be doubted, that incredible fruits will follow, if many colleges and gymnasia are established, from which the church may draw a multitude of laborers. But it is time to begin.”[^8]

This testimony was given 1563, nearly twenty-five years after the society had begun its work. Let us now go back to an earlier period and trace the progress of its colleges through the several countries of Europe. We begin with Spain and Portugal. It may be thought that, in these countries, there was little need of the Jesuits to provide against heresy, for, against that, the inquisition would be a sufficient security. Much, however, remained to be done in the revival of zeal for the church. In the space of two years (from 1553 to 1555) the order had advanced so rapidly, “that houses and colleges seemed as by a miracle, to appear in the city.” The Director needed only to stamp with his foot on Spanish soil and there sprung up, at once, edifices for the use of the society.[^9] After a short but sharp conflict with the other religious orders, the society had possession of the Peninsula. In France it encountered a vigorous opposition, from the University and Parliament of Paris, and from the regular clergy. The Gallican church was true to itself in an earnest and continued opposition to this intruder upon its rights. Notwithstanding this, the society slowly gained a footing. It was adopted by the Guises, and became their ready instrument during the wars of the League, and was signally active and efficient through all that fiery struggle in which the Huguenots were at last overthrown. In Germany, it first appeared in what are now the Catholic states, but which then, were trembling in the balance between Rome and Luther. At Ingolstadt, in 1550, Canisius was made Rector of the University already existing in that city. Before this, as we are told,[^10] “in all the Faculties, particularly in the higher sciences, the reformers had succeeded in introducing a method which was alike hostile to Logic and to Faith.” These disorders disappear at his presence. In 1551, he goes to Vienna at the earnest entreaties of Ferdinand the king of the Romans, and at his instance founds a college. Before this time, “heresy had been making extensive ravages throughout that kingdom. During more than twenty years not a person had been admitted to the Holy Orders in the city of Vienna. There was no longer a clergy, no longer priests worthy the episcopate, and consequently religion ceased. The older ecclesiastics reluctantly resumed their earlier duties. Some of them lived in the neglect of religion, others were treated with contempt, because they spoke of it to the people; the majority had embraced some one of the sects which divided Germany.”[^11] Canisius found it “necessary to commence the work from the foundation. He selected fifty young persons. He gathered them into a house near the college, and there caused them to be educated after the principles prescribed by the General.” About this time he prepared his catechism for children, which was used extensively throughout Germany as a means of educating the youth in opposition to Protestantism. This “has been translated into all languages, has been approved by the Holy See and by all the bishops. It has passed through more than five hundred editions. It was but a little work, yet it demonstrated the truth so triumphantly, that the Protestants could answer only by satires.”[^12] The letter in which Ferdinand requests the preparation of this catechism, is well worth study, as showing the sagacity with which the prince discerns and describes the influence of the Protestants and its causes, and proposes to contend against them with their own weapons. The fame of the Jesuits spreads quickly throughout Germany. They are sent for from Transylvania, from Hungary by the Archbishop of Strigonia, from Silesia by the Bishop of Breslau, from Poland by the Polish ambassador at Vienna. Canisius “was the teacher of Germany. Catholic Germany gave itself up to the Jesuits. To continue his work, he thought no means were so efficacious as to establish colleges. That of Vienna still prospered. In 1555, he founded another at Prague.”[^13] This college was freely opened to the enemies of the faith. In 1550, the foundation was laid for the Jesuits' college at Rome. In 1553, it began to furnish instruction in Scholastic Theology. Ignatius, ever on the watch for the best methods of instruction, preferred above any other that adopted by the University of Paris, and procured all his teachers from thence. Instruction was given gratuitously and with eloquence to all who chose to receive it. “It was not a seminary for the Society of Jesus alone, it was a house, at which every child and every man could receive instruction and pursue the entire course.” In 1555, the first company of a hundred scholars distributed themselves throughout Europe. Two hundred others took their place. In 1557, there were among its scholastics Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, French, Greeks, Illyrians, Belgians, Scotch, and Hungarians. These Scholars, though from so many different countries, were all subjected to the same rule. They conversed, now in the language of their native country, now in Latin, sometimes in Greek and Hebrew. On Sundays and festival days, they employed their hours of recreation in visiting hospitals, prisons, and the sick. They made excursions into the Sabine country and ancient Latium, but these excursions, which would have been pleasant as a relief from study, had an object more Christian. They evangelized, they confessed, they catechized. Every thing in their life, even the most innocent pleasure, was referred to God. Here were educated youths “full of the future” like Possevin, Bellarmin, and Aquaviva. Here instructed Avillaneda and Tolet. The Jesuits, formed under these great masters, spread themselves throughout the world. In 1564, Laynez, the second general of the order, devised the public distribution of prizes, with much pomp and public display, which custom was followed by the several colleges of the society, and by the literary world. In 1576, Bellarmin began at this college his celebrated controversial discourses. In 1584, the number of its scholars was 2107, and it retained as great a number for several successive years. Here were trained Pope Urban the 8th, Innocent the 10th, the 12th, the 13th, and Clement the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. “It was at last no longer the college of the Jesuits, but it became the college of the entire world, for all the other establishments at Rome did themselves the honor of being only appendages to this. Rome had the supremacy in education. It is pretended that the Catholic Church was the enemy of light, and yet in this single city there existed fourteen schools, which besides their particular courses, attended upon those of the Jesuits. By the simple enumeration of their names, it will be seen in what way the Holy See answered the reproach of darkness and of ignorance, which falsehood had so often urged against her. The colleges of the English, the Greeks, the Scotch, the Maronites, and the Neophytes; the colleges Capranica — Fuccioli — Mattel — Pamphili — Salviati — Ghislieri— -the German college and the college Gymnasio, constituted this brilliant constellation.”[^14]

The history of the German college at Rome is still more interesting, especially as the causes of its foundation, its successes, and its influence upon Germany are given so frankly and so much at length by the historian of the order.[^15] “Heresy had bitten Germany to the core. Every year the church saw one of the German provinces detaching itself from the centre of unity, in order to follow Luther and his disciples. To defend this empire, one of the most beautiful gems in the crown of St. Peter, Loyola had directed to Germany all the efforts of Lefevre, Bobadilla, and Lejay; of Salmeron, and Canisius;” but in vain. He then conceived the project of a special college, in which those Germans who could be wrested from heresy, might be educated at Rome. He could command priests from Italy, Spain, France, and even from beyond the Rhine, but he needed others; those who, full of life and ardor, would carry back into their own country the zeal with which he would animate them. “Upon these priests, the excellence of whose virtues would make them missionaries, and the perfection of whose studies would make them preachers and theologians, he hung his hopes for the safety of Germany. He calculated wisely, as the Lutherans themselves confess.” This college was founded at a time of pecuniary distress. The Pope subscribed an annual endowment of 1400 dollars; the cardinals, each of them, a less sum, and the entire amount of subscriptions raised in a few minutes was 8500 dollars a year, which in our day would be equivalent to seven times the same sum. This college was opened in October, in 1553, with eighteen pupils. In the Roman college only Greek, Latin, and Hebrew were taught, but students who were to contend against Lutheranism needed a peculiar training, and hence in the German college, chairs were established in Philosophy, Theology, and the study of the Scriptures. The influence of this college upon Germany is thus summed up: — Germany furnished its youth for this college, and received them again as well instructed priests, who, on their return, imparted what they had learned to their families and friends. The reformers had reproached the clergy with dissoluteness, but against these ecclesiastics, this reproach was impossible. They had accused the regular clergy of celebrating the offices of the church with an indifference amounting almost to contempt: but these German students were so devout before the altar that they secured new reverence to its sacred mysteries. They had accused the clergy of avarice, but these scholars were disinterested and liberal. The priests had been suspected of ignorance. Over them the heretics had secured an easy triumph, by wresting passages from the Scriptures. They had challenged the priests to argument, the priests had been silent, and the multitude had abandoned them to follow the Lutherans. The first pupils from the German college dissipated these notions. The people saw them confound the logic of the sectaries. They knew they came from Rome, the source of all learning, and they received them as philosophers. “To this day it is impossible to appreciate the advantages of every sort, which the Catholic Religion has derived from their agency.” The greatest houses of the empire, had their representatives at this college every scholastic year. The most illustrious names of Germany, of Italy, and other countries, are to be read upon its catalogues. At the end of the 18th century one could count twenty-four cardinals, Pope Gregory XV., six electors, nineteen princes, twenty-one archbishops and prelates, one hundred and twenty-one titulary bishops, one hundred bishops *in partibus infidelium!* forty-six abbots or generals of the order, eleven martyrs for the faith, thirteen martyrs of charity, who had sat upon the benches of this college.[^16]

Our limits will not allow us to trace with the same detail as hitherto, the progress of the society through the several countries of Europe. In the Low Countries it appeared at the critical moment, sustained much opposition and many reverses, and at last gained possession of the colleges already existing in Belgium, as well as established its own. It was the principal agency, that “transformed Belgium, which had been half Protestant, into one of the most Catholic countries of the world.”[^17] In Switzerland, in 1580, we find the papal nuncio in the Swiss cantons giving to the Romish court a gloomy picture of the state of the church in that country. Every thing in his view betokened its speedy ruin. The present remedies are declared to be insufficient, and the letter terminates as follows: “There is only one means to destroy these irreligious principles, and to restore to our corrupted morals their ancient purity, and that is the establishment of a college at Fribourg.” The college at Fribourg was founded, and its influence on the destinies of Switzerland has not yet ceased to be powerful.

To act upon England, a college was established at Douai, for the education of English youth. From this institution “were dispatched every year into England the most intelligent and courageous of its scholars.” Against the “seminarists” educated at this and other colleges on the Continent, the English government was ever on the alert. This institution was afterwards removed to Rheims. Besides this, the English college was established at Rome, which is still in being. Eight colleges were planted on the soil of Britain between 1622 and the suppression of the order in 1773, together with six residences.[^18] Within the last few years, the number of Jesuit establishments has increased in that country with astonishing rapidity.

It would be most instructive to trace the influence of the Jesuits in Poland. That unhappy country had become so decidedly Protestant at one time, that its nobility could have elected a Protestant king. What is worth recording also is, that it gave to Europe the first example of religious toleration, and this, centuries ago. But the Jesuits were soon in the field. They established colleges at Cracow, Grodno, and Pultusk. They took possession to a great extent of the nobility. The college at Pultusk contained 400 pupils, all nobles. In Poland proper, says one of their number, “hundreds of learned, orthodox and devout men of the order are employed in rooting out errors, and implanting Catholic piety, by schools and associations, by preaching and writing.” The consequences were fatal to Protestantism. “But shortly before,” says a papal nuncio in 1598, “it appeared as if heresy would completely supersede Catholicism in Poland; now Catholicism bears heresy to its tomb.”[^19]
