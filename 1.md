# 1. The Jesuits Characterized

The Society of Jesus was formed in and for a crisis in the history of the Romish church. A sudden and violent onset had been made upon this vast structure, under which it seemed to be tottering to its fall. The ignorance and dissoluteness of the priesthood, together with the glaring inconsistency of certain dogmas of the church, when tried by the common sense and conscience of man, furnished the most convincing arguments, by which the Reformers all over Europe were reasoning out the essential corruption and error of the entire system. These Reformers were able debaters and fervent preachers. Their intellectual activity had been quickened into surprising energy by their new religious life,; and they had been trained in the schools that had suddenly sprung into being in the very heat of the earliest conflicts. The strong supports of Rome, political power, ancient custom, and priestly domination, were giving way before influences stronger than them all — the convinced reason and the believing faith of the individual man. In Germany, the tide of victory had turned for the Reformers. England had broken with the pontiff. In France, in Switzerland, and the Low Countries, powerful influences were working with amazing energy beneath the surface of society. Even in Italy and Spain, able and conscientious ecclesiastics saw and confessed the corruptions of the church, and believed more than they dared to utter. The whole of the vast and mighty fabric, imposing from its gigantic structure, venerable for its age, and consecrated by the associations of centuries, seemed to be weakened in every part, and trembling in every wall and pillar, ere it should fall in upon itself, a mighty ruin.

At this crisis the plan of this wonderful society was presented to the Pope. His Holiness, as the Jesuits solemnly assert, saw in it the only, and perhaps the sufficient means to stay and turn back the impending evil, and exclaimed, " The finger of God is in it.”[^1]</span>

The society was constituted in the year 1540, by a bull from Pius III. Its zealous founder had already spent years of enthusiastic fervor, and concentrated thought, in maturing its principles. At the first moment of its organized existence, it was, in its most important features, the same which it has ever continued to be. It is true, its amazing efficiency, and the wide extent of its influence, were neither of them anticipated even in the wildest dreams of Loyola. Mad as he was, he could never have been mad enough to dream, that he had developed a power which should first educate the youth of Europe, and then make kings and pontiffs to tremble upon uneasy thrones, or to disappear from the seat of power, as at the whisper of an enchanter. As the society was tested by actual trial, its hidden capacities and its secret energies were skillfully developed by Loyola's able successors; new elements of power were added to it, and the harmonious working of its several parts was carefully adjusted, till its power and perfection astonished as well as delighted its able architects and directors. Nay, we cannot but suppose, that its head was now and then struck with terror<span id="chapter-2.xhtml#footnote-ref2">[<span class="c5">^2^</span>](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote2)</span> at the awful energy of the machinery which he essayed to guide, as the electrician will at times watch with a solicitude approaching to dread, the slumbering power that he has so quietly accumulated in the frail enginery by his side.

The constitution and spirit of the society are essentially military. Ignatius had been a soldier, and he carried all the soldier into his new order. He aimed to bring the ardor, the daring, and above all, the discipline of the camp, to do their utmost in the service of the church. The name of the head of the order was General. All the gradations and divisions were military. The authority of each superior over his subordinates was complete and despotic. Every member, from the highest to the lowest, vowed the most implicit obedience to any and to every order from the General. It was obeyed on the instant, whether it reached them by day or by night, in sickness or in health. It was obeyed to the letter, whether it sent them to the North or the South, to a point near at hand or to the opposite side of the globe, whether it would conduct them into apparent safety or certain death. The <span class="c4">Professed</span>, who were the society proper, had made a solemn vow to God, in the presence of the Holy Virgin, and to their General, who was to them in the place of God.<span id="chapter-2.xhtml#footnote-ref3">[<span class="c5">^3^</span>](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote3)</span> It was a vow of perpetual poverty, chastity, and obedience. This obedience extended to the use of the time, to the disposal of the person, to the direction of the studies, to the control of every thought and feeling of the man. The subject was rendered up to the will of the superior — as was he to his superior — not merely as the soldier surrenders his external self, nor even as the devotee yields his conscience to the direction of his confessor, but in his entire being; to be in body and spirit, in thought and feeling, nay, in look and smile, the passive executor of his decrees, and a machine controlled by his touch. Most frightful is the truth which is uttered of this society by one of its latest historians, that “it developed human devotedness to its extremest capacity, and made of the most absolute obedience, a lever, the incessant and ever present activity of which, must necessarily take the place of every other species of power."<span id="chapter-2.xhtml#footnote-ref4">[<span class="c5">^4^</span>](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote4)</span> Efficiency was the law and the life of this society. The accomplishment of its objects, in the glory and strength of the order, for the defense and enlargement of Rome, was the one aim to which every rule was shaped, and by which it was directed. For this reason, the authority of every superior was made absolute. For this, the novice was broken down to the performance of the most servile offices, and to every species of austerity — to fasting, to watchings, to long continued meditations and prayers. These austerities were no end in themselves, for it was never Loyola's design to train a company of painful ascetics, the only products of whose energy should be bloody flagellations, marvelous fastings, and unnatural self-tortures.

No, the men whom he would train were to be men for active service. So far as austerities would fit them for this object, so far were they imposed, even to the extremest limit of human endurance. Whenever they interfered with this, they were despised and rejected. If they weakened the body for labor, or the mind for study, they were strictly forbidden. The daily devotions of the church, usually esteemed of the highest consequence and enforced with the most rigid punctiliousness, were not enjoined upon the Jesuit priests. They were even forbidden, if they would interfere with any active duty. As each member must be understood by his superior and the society, both in his weakness and in his strength, it was made his duty to the order to lay open to his confessor his most secret thoughts, not only upon spiritual themes, but upon every topic whatsoever. Those thoughts which reserve would hide, those feelings at which nature would blush, were to be revealed, not merely to one, but to all. All those secret processes of thought and emotion which are a man's most sacred self, were subjected to the familiar and rude inspection of hundreds of men. That escape from inspection might be impossible, that disguise might be precluded, and that the whole society might be fused into a common mass of co-operating and harmonious minds, each man was set as a spy over his fellow; every look and smile, and even the lifting of the eyelids was to be accounted for. Loneliness and individuality were impossible, or rather they were absorbed and overborne by the force of an omnipotent and omnipresent organization. If one was sent on secret errands, or dispatched upon a delicate or difficult service, be might lay aside the dress of the order, and assume any disguise, however unseemly. The Jesuit could perform priestly duties in any diocese or cure. He might, at any moment, take the place of any ecclesiastic to any man or woman. He could preach, confess, or absolve wherever it might seem expedient. Even the highest and most awful function of the sovereign Pontiff, that of granting dispensation from religious duties, from the most sacred moral obligations and the plain commands of God, was delegated to the General, that conscience need interpose neither scruple nor delay to the execution of any measure, or to the prompt efficiency of the instrument in his hands. To secure this efficiency, the novice was obliged to pass through the most singular training<span id="chapter-2.xhtml#footnote-ref5">[<span class="c5">^5^</span>](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote5)</span> which the skill of man ever devised, to annihilate whatever is individual in will or character in a human being. It was not till after fifteen years of probation, under the most searching espionage, and the severest tests of duty and self-denial, that he was received into the lowest order of the <span class="c4">Professed</span>, and properly became a member of the society. To render him still more efficient, he was taught to forget country, home, and kindred in his order; he was trained to a complete command of his temper,<span id="chapter-2.xhtml#footnote-ref6">[<span class="c5">^6^</span>](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote6)</span> and to the entire concealment of his feelings. The storm might rage ever so fiercely within, yet it was to be masked by a countenance the most placid and serene. The opinions might be ever so distinct and the purposes ever so definite, yet on occasions, they were to be masked under words of doubtful import, or withheld by a cautious and dexterous reserve.

The Jesuit labored for years under teachers, who had themselves been trained by the most skillful masters to attain every grace of manner and every accomplishment of art and of science; and more than all, he was furnished with a convenient and corrupting casuistry which has passed into a proverb, and has been visited by the abhorrence of Christendom. By this aid, he could be easy in his dealings with those who were important to his plans, and by indulgent compliances, could win the barbarian from his idols, or gain the rich and powerful heretic to the church. While the individual was depressed and crushed, that he might subserve the efficiency of the order, in all those respects in which he did not conflict with this efficiency, he was encouraged and even compelled to make the utmost of his powers. As an independent and personal end, he was well nigh reduced to nothingness; but as a separate <span class="c4">organ</span> of a greater whole, he was taught to elevate himself to the highest possible importance, and to develop himself to his utmost capacity for perfection. His intellect was trained by a severe preparatory discipline. It was employed laboriously and constantly in eloquence and disputation, in persuasion and intrigue. His natural advantages of person or disposition were polished and perfected by art. All that he lost in conscious independence, and in individual power, was supplied, so far as possible, by the satisfaction of working the power of the great organism of which he was a director as well as a servant. What he yielded in conscious self-respect and self-reliance, was supplied by the proud delight of seeing and feeling that the mysterious resources of this organism were all the while developed in astonishing results. Into this corporate existence, did he so perfectly transfer his individual self, that, though an organization, it seemed to have compressed within its single self, all the personal life of the separate souls of which it was composed. With its interest vibrated all his sympathies, in all its movements did he feel the thrill of his individual agency. In this society the external rewards were the same. The dress and equipage of the General were originally no more costly than those of the humblest brother. The absolute domination that rested upon each and all, came at last to be esteemed a support rather than a burden. Against the espionage which searched each heart with its ever-present watchfulness, the Jesuit would think of objecting no sooner than he would complain of the All-seeing eye of God. To a man trained for years to a life of such restraints, the restraints themselves become first a dependence, and then a necessity.

One other fact deserves, to be noticed. The Jesuit was a devoted Romanist. The supremacy of the Pope and the divine authority of the church were to him unquestioned and unquestionable verities. The necessity, the aims, nay, the very life and being of his order were based upon them. If these truths were even to be questioned, the society must cease to be. The Jesuit was trained to serve and to obey the church, not to investigate the ground of her authority. He was, indeed, taught to be a reasoner. No man was more acute than he in drawing nice distinctions, none more adroit in constructing a plausible argument. But he used this power for the defense only of the church. He did not so much as dream of calling into question her claims, not even to justify them to his own honest mind. His faith was never the result of conviction, for to raise those previous questions, which are necessary to a rational faith, would be to commit a mortal sin. To whisper them to others, to breathe them to himself, would involve him in suspicion, and terminate in his ruin. As a <span class="c4">servant of the church,</span> he might think and argue and inquire. There was no boldness of investigation nor extent of research, for which he was not prepared that he might do her bidding; but to study and think, that he might satisfy self-awakened doubts or questions, it were as easy for him to breathe in water, or to swim in air.

In respect to politics, his position was not of necessity fixed. He knew but one earthly government, and that was the government of his order. He believed in no politics, except the politics of his society, directed as they were for the honor and service of the church. The interests of this <span class="c4">Civitas Dei</span>, this visible kingdom of God, were superior to the plans and projects of any earthly politician. If these last conflicted with the first, they were to be shattered in pieces as by the straight and onward march of a cannon-shot, or skillfully circumvented by the wondrous resources of a practiced society of intriguers. Court could be set against court, kingdom against kingdom, till the most skillful diplomatists were perplexed by the new and inexplicable web, which had been woven around them by an unseen hand. Plans, the most carefully considered, in which were embarked all that wealth and power could furnish, were suddenly baffled by an ambushed foe, whose hiding-place could not be traced. The Jesuit, in fact, most frequently sympathized with the intensest despotisms of Europe, but it was only because these despotisms were the most faithful friends of his order and of Rome. The free spirit, that was beginning to struggle after chartered rights, a restrained prerogative, or a free commonwealth, was usually his abhorrence, because the same spirit tended to weaken the reverence felt for the church, and to become hardened into the stubborn and refractory resistance of individual convictions. But if a monarch strengthened himself too haughtily against the authority of Rome, the Jesuit knew how to waken against him the unseen spirit of sedition, or if he were suspected of leaning to heresy, the Jesuit did not scruple to preach the lawfulness of tyrannicide in the name of liberty and the people's rights.

[^1] Cretineau Joly, Vol. i., p. 143. This work is entitled, *Histoire Religieuse, Politique et Litteraire de la Compagnie de Jesus, compose sur les documents inedits et authentiques*. 5 vols. 8vo. Paris, 1845. This, it will be observed, is our principal authority. Among the multitude of books written for and against the Jesuits, it seemed desirable to refer to those written in their favor, rather than to those which were written avowedly against the society. It seemed also better to select the most recent work, as likely to be the most able and plausible. No writer would be likely, at this day, to write largely in the interest of the Jesuits, without having access to the most abundant stores of information, and without being duly instructed how to put the most favorable construction on the weak points in their history.
